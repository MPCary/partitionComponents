For example, when performing ICA of a\n  gene expression data matrix, one may wish to partition a component into three discrete sets\n  of genes (those with highly positive weights, those with highly negative weights, and\n  those with neither); this package was created to make this task easier.\nLicense: GPL (>= 2)\nLazyData: TRUE\nDepends: R (>= 3.0.3)\nImports:\n    neuralnet (>= 1.32),\n    moments (>= 0.14)\n",
