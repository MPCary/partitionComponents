Description: For some signal-processing tasks, it is desirable to parition a component
  matrix (e.g., the S matrix in ICA or the u matrix in SVD) column-wise in order to create
  discrete subsets suitable for further analysis.  For example, when performing ICA of a
  gene expression data matrix, one may wish to partition a component into three discrete sets
  of genes (those with highly positive weights, those with highly negative weights, and
  those with neither); this package was created to make this task easier.
